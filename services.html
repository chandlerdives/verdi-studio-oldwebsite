    <!-- <h3> our services </h3> -->
    <p> We currently offer three packages, all of which work in a similar way. After our initial consultation we'll send you a client questionnaire to find out more about your company and your goals, and book a date for your project to begin. Using the information from your client questionnaire we will come up with a typography selection, full colour palette and a first design for your site.</p>
    <p>Using your copy, content and photographs we will build the pages of your website and set up social media and plugins, ensuring you have a consistent and professional design throughout. If you don't have copy, content and photographs we can use placeholders in the meantime.</p>
    <p>When your website is ready to go live we can jump on a consultation call and a website walk through.</p>
    <p>Take a look below and see which one suits your needs or get in touch to chat about your options.</p>

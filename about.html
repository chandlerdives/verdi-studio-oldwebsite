    <h3> hello there </h3>
    <p> My name is Chandler and I am a freelance web developer from Hampshire, England. If you know me really well you know that I enjoy asking curious (which sometimes end up being slightly divisive) questions to get to know people. Because of this, I think it's only fair to introduce myself by telling you some things about me. </p>
    <p> I come from background of social media and communications before spending two years as a web assistant for a beautiful lifestyle store in Winchester. Working on content management systems gave me an curiosity to know more about the front-end. Here I am now, armed with the knowledge and passion for coding beautiful custom-made websites. Verdi Studio was established in a small suburb in Brisbane only a few days before my partner and I were due to embark on a big campervan adventure around Australia. One thing's for sure: I know how to keep myself busy! </p>
    <p> An important thing to know about me is that, unlike most British people, I don't drink tea. Nor do I like coffee. What I do love is catching up over a hot chocolate (and I make a very good one!), which means I am still able to find ways to support my local coffee shop.  </p>
